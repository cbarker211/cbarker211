## About Me

I am an aspiring Data Scientist and Computational Modeller with 6 years of experience of using computational programming for scientific research. I am skilled in computational data analysis and modelling using Python, especially using NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Tkinter, with further proficiency in MATLAB and LabVIEW.

I recently completed my PhD in Earth Sciences at Royal Holloway, University of London, where I investigated the optical properties of atmospheric aerosol using optical trapping and ultraviolet Mie spectroscopy. The research has so far resulted in one publication (DOI: 10.1021/acsanm.2c02683), with a second manuscript submitted and a further three manuscripts prepared. I am now working as a Research Technician at the Science and Technology Facilities Council, undertaking a 3-month project involving the construction, testing, and demonstration of novel STORM super-resolution imaging systems. 

I also gained significant experience of computational modelling throughout my PhD, where I wrote Bash and Python scripts to automatically run Fortran light scattering codes (DDSCAT/MSTM) on Linux workstations. Additionally, I used Python and MATLAB extensively throughout the PhD for data analysis, and wrote a program using TKinter and Matplotlib to visualise datasets and perform peak detection. I really enjoyed using programming for my scientific studies, and I am currently looking for roles that will allow me to continue my development in data science and computational modelling.
