## About Me

I am a Research Fellow in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physical Geography at University College London, using GEOS-Chem to study the environmental impacts of anthropogenic emissions. I have 6 years of experience of using computational programming for scientific research, and I am skilled in computational data analysis and modelling using Python, especially using NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Tkinter, with further proficiency in MATLAB and LabVIEW.

In 2022, I completed my PhD in Earth Sciences at Royal Holloway, University of London, where I investigated the optical properties of atmospheric aerosol using optical trapping and ultraviolet Mie spectroscopy. The research has so far resulted in two publications (DOI: 10.1021/acsanm.2c02683, DOI: 10.1039/D3EA00005B), with a further three manuscripts prepared. I gained experience of computational modelling throughout my PhD, where I wrote Bash and Python scripts to automatically run Fortran light scattering codes (DDSCAT/MSTM) on Linux workstations. Additionally, I used Python and MATLAB extensively throughout the PhD for data analysis, and wrote a program using TKinter and Matplotlib to visualise datasets and perform peak detection.
